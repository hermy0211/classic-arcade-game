# Classic Arcade Game

This project was created for the Udacity Front End Developer Nanodegree.


## How to Play

Use the arrow keys to navigate your character around the screen.
Try to reach the water without getting caught by any of the bugs!

## Contributing

1. Fork the project to your own directory.
2. Create a feature branch: `git checkout -b new-feature`
3. Commit your changes: `git commit -m "Explain Feature"`
4. Push to the branch: `git push origin new-feature`
5. Submit a pull request.

Here are some features I have in mind.
- Adding a select character feature.
- Adding a counter that counts the number of wins a player has made.
- Creating some sort of feedback when the player collides with a bug.

Feel free to suggest any of the above, and any new ideas are also welcome!
